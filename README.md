Demonstration of tmate setups

This is just a demonstration of various [mxschmitt/action-tmate](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate) examples for debugging GitHub Actions Workflows.

It includes:

* A basic push example where you get to attach after work is done
* A detached example, where you attach at the end of the workflow
* A failure example, where you only attach if a step fails
* A Pull Request workflow
* A basic "Workflow Dispatch" example
